# schrodinger_poission_2d_self_consistent_solver
In this project I developed a solver which consecutively solves Poisson and Schrödinger equation to determine the charge as well as potential profile of a double gate (DG) MOSFET. Although double gate MOSFET is much backdated in today’s perspective, it’s a great choice for testing and evaluating the performance of a-self consistent solver.
